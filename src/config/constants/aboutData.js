    "Nice to see you on this ‘Waha Note’ page. There is a SPA that contains information about the main characters of the ‘Warhammer 40k’ universe. It is very good if you know any information about this Universe, and I hope that this resource will be useful to you. So, this minimalistic list of notes consists of two main pages and one additional page. The first page is titled 'Note' and contains basic information such as name, description, and other information about the current person. The second block is called 'share-note' and this page acts as an archive or collection of interesting notes. Each note can be edited, deleted or sent. In the future I am going to add a filter block, more lines for the current person and maybe a few images, also I want to add user validation. Follow the news and may the will of the Emperor be with you.",
